# DATA_LIT-VISUALIZATION-HOMEWORK-ASSIGNEMENT
In this repository, I am using plotly and matplotlib to analyze the Kaggle ML/DL Survey 2018.
You can download the dataset from this link below:

In case the Plotly charts are not appearing in Github (due to static rendering) Please check this link to observe the dynamic charts:
